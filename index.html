      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        While users interact with online services (e.g. search engines, recommender systems, conversational agents), they leave behind fine grained traces of interaction patterns. The ability to understand user behavior, record and interpret user interaction signals, gauge user satisfaction and incorporate user feedback gives online systems a vast treasure trove of insights for improvement and experimentation. More generally, the ability to learn from user interactions promises pathways for solving a number of problems and improving user engagement and satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding and learning from user interactions involves a number of different aspects - from understanding user intent and tasks, to developing user models and personalization services. A user's understanding of their need and the overall task develop as they interact with the system. Supporting the various stages of the task involves many aspects of the system, e.g. interface features, presentation of information, retrieving and ranking. Often, online systems are not specifically designed to support users in successfully accomplishing the tasks which motivated them to interact with the system in the first place. Beyond understanding user needs, learning from user interactions involves developing the right metrics and expiermentation systems, understanding user interaction processes, their usage context and designing interfaces capable of helping users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning from user interactions becomes more important as new and novel ways of user interactions surface. There is a gradual shift towards searching and presenting the information in a conversational form. Chatbots, personal assistants in our phones and eyes-free devices are being used increasingly more for different purposes, including information retrieval and exploration. With improved speech recognition and information retrieval systems, more and more users are increasingly relying on such digital assistants to fulfill their information needs and complete their tasks. Such systems rely heavily on quickly learnig from past interactions and incorporating implicit feedback signals into their models for rapid development.

      <p>Learning from User Interactions will be a highly interactive full day workshop that will provide a forum for academic and industrial researchers working at the intersection of user understanding, search tasks, conversational IR and user interactions. The purpose is to provide an opportunity for people to present new work and early results, brainstorm different use cases, share best practices, and discuss the main challenges facing this line of research.</p>

                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                      Recent years have seen great advances in using machine-learned ranking functions for relevance prediction. Any learning-to-rank framework requires abundant labeled training examples. In web search, labels may either be assigned explicitly (say, through crowd-sourced assessors) or based on implicit user feedback (say, result clicks). In personal (e.g. email) search, obtaining labels is more difficult: document-query pairs cannot be given to assessors due to privacy constraints, and clicks on query-document pairs are extremely sparse since each user has a separate corpus. Over the past several years, we have worked on techniques for training ranking functions on result clicks in an unbiased and scalable fashion. Our techniques are used in many Google products, such as Gmail, Inbox, Drive and Calendar. In this talk, I will present an overview of this line of research.

                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                     Voice-based assistants such as Alexa, Cortana and Siri, have rekindled the dream of a true conversation with a computer search engine. Hence, finding and presenting useful answers for the searchers' information needs is more important than ever. User interactions have been previously shown helpful for improving ranking, passage retrieval, and result summary generation. By viewing and interacting with the results and the underlying content, users implicitly and explicitlyindicate quality, interestingness, and relevance of content to their information needs. I will describe ongoing work on adapting these user modeling techniques for the conversational setting, where users expect more from search while doing less.

                    <p class="large" style="text-align: justify;">
                      <strong>Abstract:</strong> 
                     Neural networks have become increasingly successful throughout many machine learning applications, and in the past few years, have become the state-of-the-art approach recommender systems.  While DNNs have been well explored for applications in computer vision and natural language processing, their application to collaborative filtering-style recommendation creates new opportunities to understand user behavior and opens interesting questions on how to design these models.  In this talk, I will present recent research on user and item dynamics modeled by RNNs, challenges in successfully capturing long-range dynamics, and how contextual information factors into modeling user behavior with neural networks.
